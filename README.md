# NeWT: Natural World Tasks

This repository contains resources for working with the NeWT datasets. At this time the tasks are not publicly available because we are currently organizing a competition that will use NeWT as the evaluation set. Once the competition is finished we will release the dataset and lables (currently planned for Fall 2021).

## Benchmarking Representation Learning for Natural World Image Collections

Source code for reproducing the experiments in the CVPR 2021 paper can be found in the [benchmark](benchmark/) directory. 

## iNaturalist 2021 Dataset

The iNat2021 dataset is available [here](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2021).
